# Project Structure Guide

This is a PHP-based Posyandu (Community Health Center) management system with the following structure:

## Core Files
- [index.php](mdc:index.php) - Main entry point and welcome page
- [includes/db.php](mdc:includes/db.php) - Database connection configuration
- [includes/header.php](mdc:includes/header.php) - Common header template

## Module Organization
- `auth/` - Authentication module (login, logout, dashboard)
- `balita/` - Child data management (CRUD operations)
- `pemeriksaan/` - Health examination records
- `assets/` - Static resources (CSS, images)

## Authentication Pattern
All protected pages follow this pattern:
```php
session_start();
if (!isset($_SESSION["username"])) {
    header("Location: ../auth/login.php");
    exit();
}
```

## Database Connection
Always include [includes/db.php](mdc:includes/db.php) at the top of PHP files that need database access.

## File Naming Conventions
- CRUD operations: `data_*.php`, `input_*.php`, `edit_*.php`, `hapus_*.php`, `simpan_*.php`, `update_*.php`
- Reports: `laporan_*.php`, `cetak_*.php`
